A Flatpak release of LGOGDownloader to provide easy access to up-to-date builds
with the optional QtWebEngine dependency enabled.

Note that the included patch for the `htmlcxx` dependency was
[submitted to](https://sourceforge.net/p/htmlcxx/patches/8/) upstream, but the
project appears to be unmaintained.
